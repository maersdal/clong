# clong

A wrapper for libclang and a generator that can turn c header files into clojure apis.

Supports jna and dtype-next. Support for other ffi libs is likely.

## Rationale

Writing wrappers for c libraries is tedious and error prone. The goal of clong is to streamline the process of creating wrappers for c libraries. It is a non-goal to make the process 100% automatic. However, it should be possible to do 80-90% of the work and provide tools that are useful for building higher level APIs.

## Usage

Leiningen dependency:

```clojure
[com.phronemophobic/clong "1.4.3"]
;; only needed for parsing. not needed for generation
[org.bytedeco/llvm-platform "16.0.4-1.5.9"]
```

deps.edn dependency:

```clojure
com.phronemophobic/clong {:mvn/version "1.4.3"}
;; only needed for parsing. not needed for generation
org.bytedeco/llvm-platform {:mvn/version "16.0.4-1.5.9"}
```

_Note: If you receive an error like "Error building classpath. Could not acquire write lock for[...]" while downloading deps, try deleting the maven dep and retrying with `-Sthreads 1` to workaround this [issue](https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/TDEPS-244)._

```
rm -rf ~/.m2/repository/org/bytedeco/
clj -Sthreads 1 -P
```

### Parsing

`com.phronemophobic.clong.clang/parse` takes a header filename and the command line args to pass to clang. The most common command line args are `"-I/my/header/path"`. If you built clang locally, then you may also need to add system paths. You can see the system paths that you may by running `clang -### empty-file.h` from the command line.

`parse` returns a CXCursor. Further processing can be done via the raw api in `com.phronemophobic.clong.clang.jna.raw`. For basic usage, just use:
```clojure
(require '[com.phronemophobic.clong.clang :as clang])

(def results (->> (clang/parse "my-header.h" clang/default-arguments)
                  clang/get-children
                  (map clang/cursor-info)))
```

To get a flavor of some of the data that can be extracted, check out clong's [datafied version of the libclang API](https://github.com/phronmophobic/clong/blob/18c61d4a20a6d03e47ec49ef65b72c8baf465c39/resources/com/phronemophobic/clong/clang/api.edn).

### Generating APIs

Below is how clong can be used to generate a wrapper for libz ([full example](https://github.com/phronmophobic/clong/tree/master/examples/libz)):

```clojure
(require '[clojure.java.io :as io]
         '[clojure.string :as str]
         '[clojure.pprint :refer [pprint]]
         '[clojure.edn :as edn]
         '[com.phronemophobic.clong.clang :as clang]
         '[com.phronemophobic.clong.gen.jna :as gen])

(import 'com.sun.jna.ptr.LongByReference)

(def libz
  (com.sun.jna.NativeLibrary/getInstance "z"))

(def api (clang/easy-api "/opt/local/include/zlib.h"))

(gen/def-api libz api)

(zlibVersion) ;; "1.2.11"

(def source "clong!")

(def dest (byte-array 255))
(def dest-size* (doto (LongByReference.)
                  (.setValue (alength dest))))

(compress  dest dest-size* source (count source)) ;; 0

(.getValue dest-size*) ;; 14

(def dest2 (byte-array (count source)))
(def dest2-size* (doto (LongByReference.)
                   (.setValue (alength dest2))))
(uncompress dest2 dest2-size* dest (.getValue dest-size*)) ;; 0

(String. dest2) ;; "clong!"
```

The basic idea is to generate a description of the api with `easy-api` and generate the required structs, functions, and enums with `def-api`.

### Examples

Examples can be found in the [examples directory](https://github.com/phronmophobic/clong/tree/main/examples).

- [libz](https://github.com/phronmophobic/clong/tree/main/examples/libz)
- [freetype](https://github.com/phronmophobic/clong/tree/main/examples/freetype)
- [lmdb](https://github.com/phronmophobic/clong/tree/main/examples/lmdb)

Other projects using clong:
- [clj-graphviz](https://github.com/phronmophobic/clj-graphviz)
- [clj-libretro](https://github.com/phronmophobic/clj-libretro)
- [glfw](https://github.com/phronmophobic/clj-glfw)
- [llama.clj](https://github.com/phronmophobic/llama.clj)
- [clj-media](https://github.com/phronmophobic/clj-media)
- [clj-webgpu](https://github.com/phronmophobic/clj-webgpu)
- [ggml.clj](https://github.com/phronmophobic/ggml.clj)
- [whisper.clj](https://github.com/phronmophobic/whisper.clj)

For a more complicated example, clong's [clang interface](https://github.com/phronmophobic/clong/blob/main/src/com/phronemophobic/clong/clang/jna/raw.clj) is [generated](https://github.com/phronmophobic/clong/blob/main/src/com/phronemophobic/clong/clang.clj#L546) by clong itself.

Additionally, clong was successfully able to generate a complete wrapper for the libav* libraries, ([source](https://github.com/phronmophobic/clj-media/blob/main/src/com/phronemophobic/clj_media/audio.clj#L138)).

### Tips

- Structs will not have any fields reported if _any_ of the struct's fields has an undetermined size. If fields for a struct are missing, you may need to include more headers or make sure the system's standard paths are included (try `clang -### empty-file.h` to see what system paths might be missing).
- Clong doesn't offer any special support for automatic memory management of ffi data.
- You can include additional headers using the `-include` argument when parsing
- Parsing headers can be slow and you probably don't want to ship headers and libclang with your wrapper library. Generate the wrapper ahead of time and save the result as a edn resource that can be loaded. It is also possible to AOT generated interfaces so that the llvm and insn dependencies are required for downstream consumers.
- JNA has issues with writing to StructureByReference fields. In some cases, it's useful to override structure fields to be raw pointers.

## Future Work

- Improve documentation.
- Add support for #define values.
- Add generator that supports project panama.
- [X] Add support for other ffi libraries besides jna.
- [-] Implement clojure data interfaces over structs.
- [X] Support AOT of wrappers.
- Document AOT of wrappers.
